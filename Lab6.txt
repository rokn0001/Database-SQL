-- A - Querying tables city and country:
--  1.Using INNER JOIN ..ON, write a query that displays the name of cities, the cities' population and cities' continent. Sort the result by continent, then by city population, then by city name.-- Note that the field called 'name' is present in the two tables, use a table alias to resolve the conflict.

SELECT 
    c.name, c.population, continent
FROM
    city AS c
        INNER JOIN
    country ON c.CountryCode = country.Code
ORDER BY continent , c.Population , c.Name
LIMIT 1000000;

-- 2.Rewrite the previous query using WHERE/FROM.

SELECT 
    c.name, c.population, continent
FROM
    city AS c,
    country
WHERE
    c.CountryCode = country.Code
ORDER BY continent , c.Population , c.Name;

-- 3.Rewrite the query in question 1 to countries that became independent in 1960.


SELECT 
    country.name,c.name, c.population, continent,IndepYear
FROM
    city AS c
        INNER JOIN
    country  ON c.CountryCode = code

ORDER BY country.name,c.Population , c.Name;


-- 4.Rewrite the previous query using WHERE/FROM.


SELECT

        AND IndepYear = 1960
ORDER BY country.name,c.Population , c.Name;

-- 5.Using INNER JOIN ..ON, write a query that displays, for the city of Ottawa, the name of the city and the head of state of its country.

FROM
    city AS c
        INNER JOIN

-- 6.Using INNER JOIN ..ON, write a query that displays the name of the city, the city population, the continent, and the country population of the city of Toronto.
