Finall Practical Exam 

-- 1 -- Question 1 
-- Create the following report in a single query:
-- Select the countries (country code, country name, and life expectancy) which have a life expectancy greater than
-- the average life expectancy and rank them by life expectancy from greatest to lowest. Only display the top 10 countries.

SELECT 
    cy.code, cy.name, cy.LifeExpectancy
FROM
    country AS cy
WHERE
    LifeExpectancy > (SELECT 
            AVG(LifeExpectancy)
        FROM
            country)
ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Question 2 
-- Prepare a report where you will show the departure airport, arrival airport, the flight number,
-- the airline, the days it operates, the flight duration, the name of the departure airport as well as the departure country.
-- Only include airports that have flights departing on day 2 of the week as well as have a flight duration of at least 500 minutes
-- Sort the result by flight duration in descending order.

SELECT 
    fl.departure,
    fl.arrival,
    fl.flightnum,
    fl.airline,
    fl.day_op,

    flights AS fl
        LEFT JOIN

    left join 
    countries as cs  on ap.country =cs.code
    where fl.day_op LIKE '%2%'
        AND fl.duration <= 500;
        
-- Question 3
-- Prepare a report which will show the top aircraft for each airline based on the number of flights serviced.
-- Only display aircraft used for at least 10 flights
-- Order the result by airline and then by the total number of flights serviced.

SELECT 
    flights.airline,
    aircrafts.name AS aircraft_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_flights_serviced
FROM
    flights
        LEFT JOIN
    aircrafts ON flights.aircraft = aircrafts.code
GROUP BY flights.airline , aircrafts.name
having total_flights_serviced <=10 
ORDER BY flights.airline, total_flights_serviced DESC;

-- Question 4
-- Create a report of the airlines sorted by the most flights per airline in descending order. Make sure to include the
-- airline name. Also, remove any airlines that are based in the United Kingdom (country code 'gb').
SELECT 
    flights.airline,
    airlines.name AS airline_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_flights_serviced
FROM
    flights
        LEFT JOIN
    airlines ON flights.airline = airlines.code 
    where airlines.country != "gp"    
GROUP BY flights.airline , airlines.name
ORDER BY total_flights_serviced DESC;

-- Question 5
-- Create a view that contains the airline name and the average flight duration for the airline, sorted in descending order.
-- IMPORTANT: Please name your view in the following format q5_view_STUDENT_NUMBER where STUDENT_NUMBER should
-- be replaced with your student id number

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW q5_view_STUDENT_NUMBER AS
    SELECT DISTINCT
    name,
    (SELECT 
            AVG(flights.duration)
        FROM
            flights

            flights.airline = airlines.code) AS avg_flight_duration
FROM
    airlines
        LEFT JOIN
    flights ON flights.airline = airlines.code
ORDER BY avg_flight_duration DESC;


-- Question 6 

-- (PART 1) Create a report which selects all the columns in the "flights" table and the corresponding aircraft name for each flight as shown. Use a LEFT JOIN to make this happen.
SELECT 
    fl.*, ac.name
FROM
    flights AS fl
        LEFT JOIN
    aircrafts AS ac ON fl.aircraft = ac.code;
    
-- (PART 2) Create the same query result but this time using a correlated sub-query without a JOIN. Please submit both queries, do not just modify Part 1.
SELECT 
    fl.*, (select name from aircrafts where fl.aircraft = aircrafts.code) as aircraft_name
FROM
    flights AS fl;
