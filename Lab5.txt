-- Querying the city table:


-- 1.Create a report that displays the Code of a country along with the number of cities of that country. (GROUP BY, COUNT)

SELECT 
    countrycode, COUNT(Name) AS Total_Cities
FROM
    city
GROUP BY countrycode
ORDER BY Total_Cities DESC;



-- 2.Restrict the previous query to the countries with more than 200 cities. (GROUP BY, HAVING)

SELECT 
    CountryCode, COUNT(Name) AS Total_Cities
FROM
    city
GROUP BY CountryCode
HAVING COUNT(Name) > 200
ORDER BY Total_Cities DESC;




-- 3.Run the next query and explain what happens:
-- SELECT countrycode,COUNT(*) FROM city GROUP BY countrycode where COUNT(*) > 200;

-- i have synatx error in my SQL Syntax because it used to Where instead of Having so it make mistake if change it to Having the SQL is working.
-- and it shows the Code of a country along with the number of cities of that country with more than 200 cities.

SELECT 
    countrycode, COUNT(*)
FROM
    city
GROUP BY countrycode
HAVING COUNT(*) > 200;



-- 4.Create a report that displays the Code of a country along with the number of cities of that country and the total population of these cities. (GROUP BY, COUNT,SUM)


SELECT 
    CountryCode,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Cities,
    SUM(Population) AS Total_Population
FROM
    city
GROUP BY CountryCode
ORDER BY Total_Population DESC; 



-- 5.Create a report that displays the district, the code of a country along with the number of cities of that district. (GROUP BY on two fields, COUNT)


SELECT 
    District, CountryCode, COUNT(Name) AS Total_Cities_District
FROM
    city
GROUP BY District , CountryCode
ORDER BY CountryCode , Total_Cities_District DESC;



-- 6.Create a report that displays the the code of a country along with the number of cities of that country, the total population of these cities and the average population (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG)


SELECT 
    CountryCode,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Cities,
    SUM(Population) AS Total_Population,
    AVG(Population) AS AVG_Population
FROM
    city
GROUP BY CountryCode
ORDER BY Total_Population DESC;



-- 7.Create a report that displays the district, the code of a country along with the number of cities of that district, the total population of these cities and the average population. Select only the district starting with 'a' (GROUP BY on two fields, COUNT, SUM, AVG, HAVING)


SELECT 
    District,
    CountryCode,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Cities_District,
    SUM(Population) AS Total_Population,
    AVG(Population) AS AVG_Population
FROM
    city
GROUP BY District , CountryCode
HAVING District LIKE 'a%'
ORDER BY Total_Population DESC;



-- 8.Restrict the previous query to the districts with more than 10 cities. (HAVING, AND)


SELECT 
    District,
    CountryCode,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Cities,
    SUM(Population) AS Total_Population,
    AVG(Population) AS AVG_Population
FROM
    city
GROUP BY District , CountryCode
HAVING District LIKE 'a%' AND Total_Cities > 10;
    

-- 9.Create a report that displays the number of cities in the table, the total population, the average population, the minimal population value and the maximal population value. (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)


SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Cities,
    SUM(Population) AS Total_Population,
    AVG(Population) AS AVG_Population,
    MIN(Population)AS Least_Population,
    MAX(Population)AS Most_Population
