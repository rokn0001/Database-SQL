    city;
    
    
-- 2. List the names of all the cities sorted in descending order. 
SELECT

ORDER BY name DESC;


-- 3. List the names of unique cities. 
SELECT DISTINCT

-- 7.Calculate the number of Belgian cities stored in the table (code BEL).

-- 8.List unique districts in Brazil (code BRA). 
    
    SELECT 
    District
FROM
    city

    -- 9.Calculate the average population of the cities of Brazil (code BRA)
    SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(Population), 2) AS AVG_pop

 -- 10.  Calculate the number of records stored in the city table.
 SELECT

-- 8. Create the following report:
-- Select the continent name, the total population, and the average life expectancy
-- Return only countries that are in Europe, North America and Africa
-- Return only countries that have a life expectancy of more than 60 years
-- Exclude countries that have no data for life expectancy
-- Return only continents that have an average life expectancy of at least 50 years
-- Return only continents that have a maximum life expectancy in one of their countries of at least 70 years
-- Sort the result by life expectancy*
-- * that last point seems to break the query. It seems I have given you an impossible task? What if you try and sort by the total population? Does that work? In that case please explain why sorting by life expectancy, in this case, is not possible. Use an SQL comment to explain why it would not work. Hint: GROUP BY

select continent,LifeExpectancy,max(LifeExpectancy),sum(population) as Total_pop,avg(LifeExpectancy) as AVG_LifeExpectancy from country where Continent in ('Europe','North America','Africa') group by continent,LifeExpectancy having LifeExpectancy>60 and LifeExpectancy is null and AVG_LifeExpectancy>50 and max(LifeExpectancy)>70 order by LifeExpectancy; 

-- 9. Create the following report:
-- Select the continent, the average year of independence and the minimum and maximum years of independence for each continent
-- Select all countries that have reached independence between 1700 and 1900 and any country that reached independence after 1918
-- Omit countries whose IndepYear is not defined
-- Omit any countries whose population is less than 1,000,000
-- Omit any countries that have a life expectancy of fewer than 55 years
-- Return all countries in Nort America, Africa, and Asia but none of the countries in Europe
-- Sort the result from the earliest year of independence to the latest

select continent,IndepYear,avg(IndepYear) as Ave_IndepYear,min(IndepYear) as Min_IndepYear,max(IndepYear) as Max_IndepYear from country where continent like in ('NorthAmerica','Africa','Asia') and not like in 'Europe' group by continent,IndepYear having IndepYear between 1700 or 1900 and IndepYear>1918 or IndepYear is not null or population>1000000 or LifeExpectancy>55;
