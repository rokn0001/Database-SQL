-- 1. Calculate the number of British cities stored in the table (code GBR)
SELECT 
    countrycode, COUNT(*)
FROM
    city
WHERE
    countrycode = 'GBR';

-- 2. Calculate the average population of the cities of China (code CHN)
SELECT 
    countrycode, AVG(population)
FROM
    city
WHERE
    countrycode = 'CHN';

-- 3. Create the following query:
-- Select all available data matching the constraints below
-- Select data from all countries except those in Europe and Africa
-- Sort the output by continent and then by name

SELECT 
    name, continent
FROM
    country
WHERE
    continent NOT IN ('Europe' , 'Africa')
ORDER BY continent , name;

-- 4. Create the following query:
-- Select all data for all countries whose IndepYear field (column) is not defined
-- Only return countries whose names contain the letter 'a'
-- Only return countries whose names have at least 5 characters
-- Sort the result by the country name
-- Return only 20 countries, omitting the first 10 countries in the list

-- 5. Create the following report:
-- Display the district, the country code and the following aggregations:
-- the total population of the cities in each district
-- the average population of the cities in each district
-- the maximum population of the cities in each district
-- the minimum population of the cities in each district
-- the population difference between the most populated and least populated city in each district
-- Select only the districts the contain the letter 'c' in their name
-- Limit the result set to the top 50 most populated districts

-- 7. Create the following report:
-- Displays the CountryCode of a country along with the number of cities in that country and the total population of its cities
-- Returns the population of the city with the most inhabitants
-- Returns the population of the city with the least inhabitants
-- Returns only countries that have at least 50 cities
-- Sort the result by the most populated cities in ascending order
